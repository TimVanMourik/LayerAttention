This is an example of an analysis repository. The content of this repository is automatically visualised by https://giraffe.tools. Find the main project in https://giraffe.tools/github/TimVanMourik/GiraffeTools.

## Usage:
Simply go to:

https://giraffe.tools/github/$username/$repository/$branch

So for this repository, that would be:

https://giraffe.tools/github/TimVanMourik/SomeGiraffeExample/master

This process is completely automatic if you have a GIRAFFE.yml file in the root of your repository that points to the relevant tool files in this repository. Documentation will follow. 

## Work In Progress
This application is actively being developed and in the future will support
* Visualisations of workflows
* Saving (committing) your analysis directly to GitHub
* Visualisin the data that flows through the pipeline
